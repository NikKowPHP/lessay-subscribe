1. Define the Core Features and User Flow
Goal: Clearly outline the app's functionality and user journey.
Steps:
1. User Authentication: Allow users to log in or sign up.
2. Initial Assessment: For new users, conduct a language proficiency evaluation using the same structure as lessons, but with assessment-specific content.
3. Lesson Delivery: Deliver AI-generated lessons in a fixed, sequential format.
4. Voice Response Capture: Use the browser's voice recognition to capture user responses.
5. Adaptive Learning: Analyze user performance to refine future lessons.

2. Set Up the Development Environment
Goal: Prepare the tools and infrastructure for development.
Steps:
1. Choose a Tech Stack: Next.js (frontend), Node.js (backend), PostgreSQL (database), and Docker (containerization).
2. Set Up Docker: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local development.
3. Initialize the Project: Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
Configure Aliases: Set up module aliases (e.g., @/) for cleaner imports.

3. Implement User Authentication
Goal: Allow users to log in and manage their profiles.
Steps:
Integrate Supabase: Use Supabase for authentication and user management.
2. Create Login/Signup Pages: Design and implement the UI for user authentication.
Store User Data: Save user profiles and authentication tokens in the database.
---
4. Build the Initial Assessment Module
Goal: Evaluate new users' language proficiency using the same structure as lessons.
Steps:
1. Design Assessment Content: Create assessment-specific prompts and model answers.
2. Integrate Voice Recognition: Use the browser's Web Speech API to capture user responses.
3. Store Assessment Data: Save the evaluation results and learning purposes in the database.
---
5. Develop the Lesson Generation System
Goal: Generate AI-driven lessons tailored to each user's needs.
Steps:
1. Define Lesson Structure: Use the fixed, sequential format (e.g., prompt → model answer).
2. Integrate AI Models: Use pre-trained models for speech-to-text, language processing, and lesson planning.
3. Store Lesson Sequences: Save the generated lessons in the database for later delivery.
---
6. Implement the Lesson Delivery Interface
Goal: Present lessons to users and capture their responses.
Steps:
1. Design Lesson UI: Create a clean, user-friendly interface for displaying prompts and model answers.
2. Integrate Voice Recognition: Use the Web Speech API to capture user responses.
3. Compare Responses: Strictly compare user responses to the predefined model answers.
---
7. Build the Adaptive Learning System
Goal: Analyze user performance to refine future lessons.
Steps:
1. Store User Recordings: Save user voice responses for offline analysis.
2. Analyze Performance: Use AI to evaluate acoustics, accent, and pronunciation.
3. Identify Error Patterns: Track common mistakes and areas of difficulty.
4. Adjust Lesson Content: Update future lessons based on the analysis results.
5. Track Progress: Monitor user progress and adjust lesson difficulty dynamically.
---
8. Test and Iterate
Goal: Ensure the app works as expected and refine the user experience.
Steps:
1. Unit Testing: Test individual components (e.g., authentication, lesson delivery).
2. Integration Testing: Test the end-to-end user flow (e.g., assessment → lesson delivery → adaptive learning).
3. User Testing: Gather feedback from real users and iterate on the design and functionality.
---
9. Prepare for Deployment
Goal: Deploy the app to a production environment.
Steps:
Optimize Performance: Minify code, optimize images, and enable caching.
Set Up CI/CD: Automate testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or Vercel.
3. Deploy to Production: Host the app on a platform like Vercel or AWS.
---
10. Monitor and Maintain
Goal: Ensure the app runs smoothly and continues to improve.
Steps:
Monitor Performance: Use tools like PostHog or Sentry to track errors and user behavior.
2. Gather Feedback: Continuously collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
Update Content: Regularly update lesson content and AI models to keep the app relevant.
