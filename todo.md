# FIX

- [ ] creating the initial lessons in onboarding   should also disable the 'go to lessons'

- [ ] move most of the provider  logic to the backend (identify areas that can be processed on the backend and modify it, more about the provider data initialization, not the flow of the lesson or onboarding.  )
