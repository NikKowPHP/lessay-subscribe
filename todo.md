-[] check lessons generation and progress tracking
- [] lesson generation prompt is very bad
- [] checklessons and generate new ones is not working
- [x] Clarified that lesson.focusArea in UI is already user-friendly; normalizeTopic is for internal use only.
- [] disable redirect from onboarding when user is seeing results and waiting for lesson generation
